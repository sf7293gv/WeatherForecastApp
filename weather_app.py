"""Part 1: Weather Forecast  

Use the forecast API to create a detailed, neatly formatted 5-day forecast, for anywhere the user chooses. Ask the user for the location.

Make sure your API key is not coded into your program. Your program should read the key from an environment variable. 

Use a query parameter dictionary in the request.

Your forecast should show the temperature and unit (your choice of F or C), weather description, and wind speed for every three hour interval, over the next 5 days.

Your program should handle errors. What type of errors do you anticipate? How will you deal with them?
